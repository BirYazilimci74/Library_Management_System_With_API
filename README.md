# Library_Management_System_With_API

This is a Library Management System project where I used **ASP.NET** and **Windows Forms**. The project is divided into two parts:

- The **API scripts** are located in the `LibraryAPI` folder.
- The **Windows Forms** project can be found in the `LibraryManagementSystemWithAPI` folder.

### Steps to Run the Project:
1. Run the API by entering the following command in the terminal:
dotnet watch run

2. Add a migration with:
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>

3. Update the database by running:
dotnet ef database update

4. Finally, run the **Windows Forms** project in **Visual Studio**.

If you encounter any issues while running the project, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn:
